**Product Design → Product Management | Automotive & AI Innovation**

I bring **6+ years of automotive product design and development** experience (Mercedes-Benz, Jeep, Nissan) and a **Master’s in Innovation Design Management (Germany, 2024)**. I connect engineering rigor with product thinking by using Agile practices, data, and clear documentation to ship higher-quality features faster.
